Image Steganography - Python and Tkinter

Daniel Koztepe

Introduction:
This project demonstrates how to use image steganography (hiding data in images) in a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using the Python programming language and its Tkinter toolkit. This app gives users the ability to:

Select and load an image
Enter a secret message
Embed the message into the image
Extract and read hidden messages from stego-images
